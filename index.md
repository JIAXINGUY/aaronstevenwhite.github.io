# What I do

I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/index.html) at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), with secondary appointments in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) and the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/) and an affiliation with the [Goergen Institute for Data Science](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/). I'm also Director of the [FACTS.lab](http://factslab.io) at UR, and I co-lead the [MegaAttitude Project](http://megaattitude.io) and the [Decompositional Semantic Initiative](http://decomp.io) with [Ben Van Durme](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Kyle Rawlins](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/rawlins/).

# News

I will be accepting up to three PhD students in Linguistics and/or Computer Science to start Fall 2020.

I did [an interview](https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights/94-decompositional-semantics-with-aaron-white) about the [Decompositional Semantic Initiative](http://decomp.io) on NLP Highlights.

# Where I've been

Before joining the University of Rochester, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu)'s [Science of Learning Institute](http://scienceoflearning.jhu.edu/) with affiliations in the [Department of Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.jhu.edu/) and the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) from 2015 to 2017. While at Hopkins, I worked on the [Decompositional Semantics Initiative (Decomp)](http://decomp.net/), led by [Ben Van Durme](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/) and [Kyle Rawlins](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/rawlins/), and I led the [MegaAttitude Project](http://megaattitude.io) with [Kyle Rawlins](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/rawlins/).

I received my PhD in [Linguistics](http://ling.umd.edu/) from the [University of Maryland](http://umd.edu/) in 2015. My dissertation, [_Information and Incrementality in Syntactic Bootstrapping_]({{ site.url }}/papers/white_information_2015.pdf), was co-advised by [Valentine Hacquard](http://ling.umd.edu/~hacquard/) and [Jeff Lidz](http://ling.umd.edu/~jlidz/). Before that, I received my BA in [Linguistics](http://linguistics.ucsc.edu/) from the [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://ucsc.edu/) in 2009, followed by a year in the [Department of Linguistics](http://ling.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](http://umd.edu/) as a [Baggett Fellow](http://ling.umd.edu/baggett/).
